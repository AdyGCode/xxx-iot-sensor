# XXX IoT Sensor

A core project template for the analysis of current technologies and their application to
industry - specifically within Internet of Things.

This code base is not complete, but **no** contributions are required.

## General Information

* Free software: Open Software License ("OSL") v. 3.0
* Documentation: To be added

## Features

* Built-in Hardware Sensor (Raspberry Pi) details monitored and delivered via MQTT
* Temperature, pressure and humidity and other sensor inputs monitored and delivered via MQTT

## Requirements

This code presumes certain hardware is being used.

### Hardware:

* Raspberry Pi 3B or later
* Raspberry SenseHAT

The SenseHAT may be replaced with the equivalent hardware, but in this case any driver code, or
similar, will need to be created, or installed from the required suppliers.

### Software

MQTT Server

- anonymous access allowed for this simple example
- default port is 1883

### Package Requirements

This project requires the following package(s):

| `paho-mqtt`  | Python MQTT package                | v1.5.1 or later     |
| `piview`     | Raspberry Pi Information package   | v2.0.3 or later     |
| `psutil`     | system utilities                   | v5.8.0 or later     |

Remaining packages are Python 'built-ins'.

### Package Installation
